Description: Abstraction to system policy and authentication features
 KAuth is a framework to let applications perform actions as a
 privileged user.
 .
 The KDE Authorization API allows developers to write desktop
 applications that run high-privileged tasks in an easy,
 secure and cross-platform way. Previously, if an application
 had to do administrative tasks, it had to be run as root, 
 using mechanisms such as sudo or graphical equivalents, 
 or by setting the executable's setuid bit. This approach 
 has some drawbacks. For example, the whole application code,
 including GUI handling and network communication, had to
 be done as root. More code that runs as root means
 more possible security holes.
 .
 The solution is the caller/helper pattern. With this pattern,
 the privileged code is isolated in a small helper tool that
 runs as root. This tool includes only the few lines of code
 that actually need to be run with privileges, not the whole
 application logic. All the other parts of the application 
 are run as a normal user, and the helper tool is called when
 needed, using a secure mechanism that ensures that the user
 is authorized to do so. 
 .
 Contains development files for kauth.
